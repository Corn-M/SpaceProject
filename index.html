                This site contains various tools for anyone interested in astronomy/astrophysics to use. These were
                created to help people understand how astrophysical equations and properties affect the
                characteristics and appearence of celestial objects and their interactions.<br><br>

                The planet calculations, star calculations, and black hole calculations are for designing a respective
                celestial object by inputting just a few basic characteristics. After you input the known characteristics
                of your object, click calculate to see what other characteristics can be calculated based on the
                information provided! An approximation of what your planet, star, or black hole might look like is also
                depicted.<br><br>

                The solar system model is where you can create a solar system by adding planets and providing an initial
                distance and velocity. This simulation exemplifies Kepler's laws and the elliptial shape of orbiting
                bodies.
            </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px; padding-top: 15px; font-size: 17px">
                Enter any combination of characteristics you would like to see what planet, star, or black hole they
                would create. All inputted characteristics must be within the ranges provided to the left of the
                text field.
            </p>

                <p class="font-italic" style="padding-top: 5px; font-size: 15px">
                    In this example, the inputted mass must be a number between 0.05 and 400.
                </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px; padding-top: 10px; font-size: 17px">
                When one text field is selected, other text fields will light up too. The text fields that are
                highlighted are the ones needed to calculate the text field you have selected. So if you want
                to calculate a specific characteristic, just select it to see what you need to input first.
                When there is more than one way to calculate a characteristic, text fields will be highlighted
                in different colors. Each color represents a separate way to calculate the characteristic, so
                only the text fields highlighted with the same color must be inputted to find the desired
                characteristic.

                    In this example, to calculate luminosity, the user must input either radius and temperature,
                    temperature and absolute visual magnitude, or mass.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px; padding-top: 10px; font-size: 17px">
                Once you have inputted your characteristics, click calculate to calculate all the characteristics
                possible based on the provided information and to render a picture of what your celestical object
                might look like. To reset both the text fields and the picture, click reset! <br><br>

                More information on realistic properties and definitions and equations for each characteristic are
                provided in the notes section of these pages.

                Enter a starting velocity and customize your planet's color, then click anywhere on the black
                area to the right to place your planet. Then, watch it orbit a Sun-like star! You can pause
                and play the simulation by pushing the pause/play button, or reset the model to the original
                Earth-Sun model with the reset button. Note that there is a limit of ten planets that can be
                added to the model.<br><br>

                More precise models can be created with the menu below. While the simulation is paused,
                planets can be added or removed and the user can set a precise initial radius and velocity
                for the planet. The mass of the star can also be changed. Be sure to initialize changes by
                pressing the initialize button before hitting play.

                This menu also includes presets, which will input the planets of the solar system into the
                model, including their velocities and orbital radii, which can then be adjusted. Just select
                the preset you want and hit load. Note that the larger solar system models will run slowly at
                first, but after some time, they should run more smoothly.<br><br>

                Lastly, the dimensions of the window may be edited by just typing a new one into the text field
                on the right. You can also turn off/on the lines displaying the trajectory of the planets.
